# Normalization for algebraic effect handlers

A proof of normalization (termination of evaluation) for a language [PPS19] with
polymorphic algebraic effects.
It relies on direct-style unary logical relations defined as a fixed-point,
inspired by the step-indexed biorthogonal binary relations in [Bie+18].

algebraic effects and handlers”.
